	<h1>The Gigsaw NextGen Sequence Assembly Simulator</h1>
	    <div class="bodydiv">
	    Gigsaw is a script that produces a physical model simulation of 
Next Generation Sequencing experiments. These models are ideal for 
teaching and illustratin g the concepts and challenges of Next 
Generation Sequencing. The model is created as PDF which can then be 
printed and cut out. Some examples are on the <a href="examples.html">examples page</a>. The code for Gigsaw and associated documentation is available on request.
 <p> You can run Gigsaw <a href="/gigsaw/cgi-bin/gigsaw.pl">here</a>
